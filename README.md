# feed-the-dino
A space invader style game where you control a purple triceratops and have to feed it orange candy

In order to run the game you will need python 2.7 with pygame installed.
If you download the files you can run the game using 
        python main.py
which should open a window where the game will execute.

You can also try running nommin.py and see what happens
